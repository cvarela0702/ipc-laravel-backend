I want this project to be a recipe portal, where users can share and view recipes on line. This is the backend, which will be completely in PHP with laravel, and it will serve as an API engine. The frontend will be a completely different project, using NextJS and consuming the exposed APIs by this backend. The models I have considered so far, are based on the operations that the users can do with the recipes. The operations that users are capable of doing are:
    - See recipes list
        - and be able to sort by:
            - posted date (oldest - newest)
            - popularity (by comments added)
            - rating (by stars given to it)
    - see individual recipes
    - Search for recipes
    - Flag favorite recipes
    - Provide feedback to recipes
    - Ask questions about recipes
    - answer questions about recipes
what are the models that should be created to meet those requirements?

I want now to create resource controllers and migrations for the given models

./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_users_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_recipes_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_comments_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_ratings_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_favorites_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_questions_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_answers_table

./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller UserController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller RecipeController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller CommentController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller RatingController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller FavoriteController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller QuestionController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller AnswerController --resource

I want now to expose the functionality for this via REST APIs so the frontend can reach them

I want the recipes to have association with categories, the categories are a single way to categorize where the recipes belong to, examples of categories: Mexican, Italian, Vegan, Low carb. One recipe can belong to multiple categories and one category can have multiple recipes.

------

I want to test what I have so far, to make sure that all operations are working as expected

------

I got this error while running test: Class "Database\Factories\CategoryFactory" not found

-------

give me the code to generate factories for all other models, and from now on, all command lines that consider "artisan", generate them as this instead:
"./vendor/bin/sail artisan"

------

help me define the tests for all controllers except user and also ignore the ones that have tests already

I want to implement now the ability to search so the application can have the ability to expose search capabilities

I'd like to implement this with laravel scout and meilisearch support instead

now I want to add authorization to edit and delete operations, so it happens that only the users who created a particular record can edit it or delete it. No other user should be able to edit or delete records that were not created by that user.

------

I want to add validation to the operations of the controllers for all the models now

I want to add an attribute to the categories, an image, that is required. I want to consider any other attributes that I need for the category.

-----
I want now to create a seeder for categories, but something that has real potential values for recipe categories, I want the seeder to generate real records based on those real values for recipes categories and fill the fields for name, slug and description, and leave image out.
