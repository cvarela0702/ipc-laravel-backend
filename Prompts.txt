I want this project to be a recipe portal, where users can share and view recipes on line. This is the backend, which will be completely in PHP with laravel, and it will serve as an API engine. The frontend will be a completely different project, using NextJS and consuming the exposed APIs by this backend. The models I have considered so far, are based on the operations that the users can do with the recipes. The operations that users are capable of doing are:
    - See recipes list
        - and be able to sort by:
            - posted date (oldest - newest)
            - popularity (by comments added)
            - rating (by stars given to it)
    - see individual recipes
    - Search for recipes
    - Flag favorite recipes
    - Provide feedback to recipes
    - Ask questions about recipes
    - answer questions about recipes
what are the models that should be created to meet those requirements?

I want now to create resource controllers and migrations for the given models

./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_users_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_recipes_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_comments_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_ratings_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_favorites_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_questions_table
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:migration create_answers_table

./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller UserController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller RecipeController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller CommentController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller RatingController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller FavoriteController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller QuestionController --resource
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller AnswerController --resource

I want now to expose the functionality for this via REST APIs so the frontend can reach them

I want the recipes to have association with categories, the categories are a single way to categorize where the recipes belong to, examples of categories: Mexican, Italian, Vegan, Low carb. One recipe can belong to multiple categories and one category can have multiple recipes.

------

I want to test what I have so far, to make sure that all operations are working as expected

------

I got this error while running test: Class "Database\Factories\CategoryFactory" not found

-------

give me the code to generate factories for all other models, and from now on, all command lines that consider "artisan", generate them as this instead:
"./vendor/bin/sail artisan"

------

help me define the tests for all controllers except user and also ignore the ones that have tests already

I want to implement now the ability to search so the application can have the ability to expose search capabilities

I'd like to implement this with laravel scout and meilisearch support instead

------

now I want to add authorization to edit and delete operations, so it happens that only the users who created a particular record can edit it or delete it. No other user should be able to edit or delete records that were not created by that user.

I want to add validation to the operations of the controllers for all the models now

-----

I want to add an attribute to the categories, an image, that is required. I want to consider any other attributes that I need for the category.

-----
I want now to create a seeder for categories, but something that has real potential values for recipe categories, I want the seeder to generate real records based on those real values for recipes categories and fill the fields for name, slug and description, and leave image out.

is it possible for you to read a postman collection exported file, then take a look at one of the folders (recipes), then duplicate that folder into categories, and replace all instances and references from recipe(s) to category(ies), then put the result in a postman collection file that could be imported into postman?

----- from chatGPT
I have the following category values:
$categories = [
            ['name' => 'Mexican', 'description' => 'Traditional Mexican cuisine'],
            ['name' => 'Italian', 'description' => 'Authentic Italian dishes'],
            ['name' => 'Vegan', 'description' => 'Plant-based recipes'],
            ['name' => 'Low Carb', 'description' => 'Low carbohydrate meals'],
            ['name' => 'Desserts', 'description' => 'Sweet treats and desserts'],
            ['name' => 'Seafood', 'description' => 'Delicious seafood recipes'],
            ['name' => 'BBQ', 'description' => 'Barbecue and grilling recipes'],
            ['name' => 'Breakfast', 'description' => 'Breakfast and brunch ideas'],
        ];
Please generate an image for each that will be shown in the frontend as a navigation icon / image. Don't include any texts, just an icon / image, with no background (use transparent background if possible)

----- from chatGPT

still waiting for the other images

----- from chatGPT

then, instead of generating the images, search for them on the internet, and download them or give me the links, so I can use free royalty images from internet.
Follow the same criteria to search for those images, that represent recipe categories, etc.

I want now to create a seeder for recipes, but something that has real potential values for recipes, I want the seeder to generate real records based on those real values for recipes and fill their fields. For image and video URL fields, fill them with something like the following: "http://localhost/images/recipes/{slug}.svg" for image and "http://localhost/videos/recipes/{slug}.mp4"

what are the best practices to handle and show ratings at item level in a list of items?. Let's say for example the list of recipes in the frontend that I have. should I have additional fields at record level that have the sum for the ratings and the average for the stars?, or is that something that could / should be calculated on the fly?

-----
I want now to have the ability to search by slug for the recipe, given the fact that the slug is unique and the frontend would request categories by slug rather than by id
